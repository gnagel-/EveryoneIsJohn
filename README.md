# EveryoneIsJohn
project app for CMPM131

This is the master branch, where our fancy, working stuff should go.

Update your branch from master (your branch has been conveniently created with your name), work on stuff on your branch, create and delete branches as needed, and then we'll figure out how to merge stuff when we get there
